# Define variables
a = True
b = False
c = True

# Using 'and'
print(a and b)  # Output: False (because b is False)      all must be true 

# Using 'or'
print(a or b)   # Output: True (because a is True)       just one true

# Using 'not'
print(not a)    # Output: False (because a is True)

# Combining logical operators
print(a and not b)  # Output: True (because a is True and not b is True)
print(a or (b and c))  # Output: True (because a is True, so the whole expression is True)
print((not a or b) and c)  # Output: True (because not a is False, b is False, so we need to check c, which is True)
